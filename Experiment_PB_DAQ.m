function varargout = Experiment_PB_DAQ(varargin)
%EXPERIMENT_PB_DAQ MATLAB code file for Experiment_PB_DAQ.fig
%      EXPERIMENT_PB_DAQ, by itself, creates a new EXPERIMENT_PB_DAQ or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = EXPERIMENT_PB_DAQ returns the handle to a new EXPERIMENT_PB_DAQ or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      EXPERIMENT_PB_DAQ('Property','Value',...) creates a new EXPERIMENT_PB_DAQ using the
%      given property value pairs. Unrecognized properties are passed via
%      varargin to Experiment_PB_DAQ_OpeningFcn.  This calling syntax produces a
%      warning when there is an existing singleton*.
%
%      EXPERIMENT_PB_DAQ('CALLBACK') and EXPERIMENT_PB_DAQ('CALLBACK',hObject,...) call the
%      local function named CALLBACK in EXPERIMENT_PB_DAQ.M with the given input
%      arguments.
